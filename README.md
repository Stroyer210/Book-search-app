## Description  :bookmark_tabs:

I spent a lot of hours into developing the Book-search-app, aiming to create a seamless experience for users. While I managed to implement book search functionality successfully using the MERN stack, I couldn't pass the sign-in process. Despite my best efforts, I've been unable to resolve the error that occurs at sign-in and/or login. It's been frustrating, and despite days of troubleshooting, I still can't figure it out what the issue is. I'm uploading the project as is, but maybe after a while after the bootcamp I will check again on it and fix the bug.

## Installation :computer:
You can check the app by cloning the repository and runnin the next commands:

    npm i
    npm run develop
    
## Usage :bar_chart:
This is how the app should looks like:
![the main page.](client/public/screen1.png)

![The about page.](client/public/screen2.png)

As you can see, when you open the app you can check any book that you would like, and after login in you can save the books you want and go to the savedBooks page.
